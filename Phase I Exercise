There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
The 4 was made in 1984 (wikipedia).
•	What operating system does it run? 
It primarily used the CP/M operating systems (although could also use MS-DOS according to wikipedia). 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Apparently it cost around about USD $1,795 then (around $4,400 today). I saw it advertised on ebay for prices starting at USD 299.00. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The most noted strength of the KAYPRO seem to be its easy to read text (the screen and text size and color). For its time, it was said to have user-friendly software (like an office processor that included spellcheck!) and applications as well as transportable data (CSV files). The company was loyal to customers, but perhaps because of this loyalty it didn't adapt it's operating system to competition, as they moved away from CP/M. Another downside to the KAYPRO is its weight (it is SO heavy!).  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

I turned on the switch on the back and the computer started up. I placed the diskette in A and the comman line appears. I couldn't get anything I was typing to appear on the screen. Then I noticed that the keyboard was disconnected from the computer. Even after connecting (what looked like a phone jack), nothing I typed appeared on the screen. I will follow up with a classmate about this.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
According to the "Preface to the Second Edition" in the Apple II User Guide, the Apple IIe came out in January 1983 (vii).
•	What operating system does it run? 
I am not sure what all the differences between languages, systems, etc are but I think it uses a DOS 3.3 SYSTEM based on the information on the diskette (and on page 21 of the User Guie).
It also uses a language called BASIC. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
In 1983 the computer cost $2495.00 (according to http://www.oldcomputers.net/macintosh.html). 
Using the inflation calculator (http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), this price today would be around $5,960.67 (with a cumulative inflation rate of 138.9%). 
The prices on ebay varied greatly-- from $69.00 to $4,100-- depending on included software and states of disrepair (http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=apple+iie+computer)
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The IIe (e = enhanced) built-in what had previously been offered as add-ons. It is best known for being the longest running model, having been sold for 11 years! The IIe offered a much improved keyboard, with the ability to vary between capital and lowercase letters, four-directional cursors and other keys (that today come standard). It was lower cost and better functioning than previous models. Still, it was too expensive for most households to afford.  
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

I was able to turn the machine on and laugh at the copy in the typing program! I felt pretty bad about all the "seeeaaaa dragon" noises, but I played for 20 minutes... enough time to realize I will never beat one of your high scores hahahah.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
1987
•	What operating system does it run? 
3.3-3.4, 4.0–6.0.2, 6.0.3–6.0.8, 7.0-7.5.5
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then, it cost US$2900 (dual floppy) and US$3900 (with 20 MB hard drive), which today would be USD $6074.30 and $8168.89, repectively. The first computer I saw on eBay was selling for USD $ 1,300! There were none for sale in the DC area on craigslist. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It seems that this computer is best known for being to accomodate 2 (and 3 in the case of SE) floppy disks. Some of its upgrades are an "internal drive bay," a keyboard and mouse, faster processing, more relable and long lasting and a cooling fan for temperature regulation. Compared to the Classic that would replace it, the SE was slow and expensive. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

I read some of Marble Springs and explored Story Space (moon to Deena), We Descend and some of the standard apps (calculator and alarm clock were the only ones that opened, and the rest took up too much memory, lol). I tried to use some of the applications like "Graph Maker," but it appears the computer doesn't have the necessary cards for such applications.

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
1982
•	What operating system does it run? 
VECTREX ran on a vector-based system.
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Then, it costs USD $199.00, which is about $470.00 now. I found several on sale at amazon for USD $292.00.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?


Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

I had the most fun with this machine! I tried to play "Head's Up," but the cartidge didn't seem to work. 
===================================================================================================================
AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
Made in 1985 but not released oficially until 1986. 
•	What operating system does it run? 
AmigaOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
US$1295 + US$300 (Monitor), which would be USD $2863.74 and USD $663.42. Their price on ebay ranged from USD $300.00 - $6,000.00
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
According to wikipedia the Amiga was a great bargin-- it was affordable given the extensive operations it was capable of. It was well known for video editing software and for home computers (games). It seems that the company's innvoative edge sputtered out. They went bankrupt on a model that failed. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.

I foundt his a little harder to get up and runnning...

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
1989
•	What operating system does it run? 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
USD $6269 (now $13,863.17). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
Wikipedia states that this computer was a "workhorse," used mostly in businesses. 
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?

I acutally remember using one of these at my friend Nora's house when I was in elementary school!
